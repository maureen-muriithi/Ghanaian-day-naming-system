#### General Information

> This web application takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
> Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.
> Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, this app will help determine the day of the week from a specific date. And also give an Akan Name

#### Setup

- For this week's Independent Project, you will be required to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.

- The application should check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid, the user should be alerted and asked to enter a valid one. For example:
- An invalid day should be (d<=0) or (d>31)
- An invalid month should be (m<= 0) or (m > 12)

- The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
